## Quick Start

DeerFlow is developed in Python, and comes with a web UI written in Node.js. To ensure a smooth setup process, we recommend using the following tools:

### Recommended Tools
- **[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/):**
  Simplify Python environment and dependency management. `uv` automatically creates a virtual environment in the root directory and installs all required packages for you—no need to manually install Python environments.

- **[`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):**
  Manage multiple versions of the Node.js runtime effortlessly.

- **[`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation):**
  Install and manage dependencies of Node.js project.

### Environment Requirements
Make sure your system meets the following minimum requirements:
- **[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/):** Version `3.12+`
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/):** Version `22+`

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow.git
cd deer-flow

# Install dependencies, uv will take care of the python interpreter and venv creation, and install the required packages
uv sync

# Configure .env with your API keys
# Tavily: https://app.tavily.com/home
# Brave_SEARCH: https://brave.com/search/api/
# volcengine TTS: Add your TTS credentials if you have them
cp .env.example .env

# See the 'Supported Search Engines' and 'Text-to-Speech Integration' sections below for all available options

## Architecture

DeerFlow implements a modular multi-agent system architecture designed for automated research and code analysis. The system is built on LangGraph, enabling a flexible state-based workflow where components communicate through a well-defined message passing system.

![Architecture Diagram](./assets/architecture.png)
> See it live at [deerflow.tech](https://deerflow.tech/#multi-agent-architecture)

The system employs a streamlined workflow with the following components:

1. **Coordinator**: The entry point that manages the workflow lifecycle
   - Initiates the research process based on user input
   - Delegates tasks to the planner when appropriate
   - Acts as the primary interface between the user and the system

2. **Planner**: Strategic component for task decomposition and planning
   - Analyzes research objectives and creates structured execution plans
   - Determines if enough context is available or if more research is needed
   - Manages the research flow and decides when to generate the final report

3. **Research Team**: A collection of specialized agents that execute the plan:
   - **Researcher**: Conducts web searches and information gathering using tools like web search engines, crawling and even MCP services.
   - **Coder**: Handles code analysis, execution, and technical tasks using Python REPL tool.
   Each agent has access to specific tools optimized for their role and operates within the LangGraph framework

4. **Reporter**: Final stage processor for research outputs
   - Aggregates findings from the research team
   - Processes and structures the collected information
   - Generates comprehensive research reports

## Text-to-Speech Integration

DeerFlow now includes a Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature that allows you to convert research reports to speech. This feature uses the volcengine TTS API to generate high-quality audio from text. Features like speed, volume, and pitch are also customizable.

### Using the TTS API

You can access the TTS functionality through the `/api/tts` endpoint:

```bash
# Example API call using curl
curl --location 'http://localhost:8000/api/tts' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "text": "This is a test of the text-to-speech functionality.",
    "speed_ratio": 1.0,
    "volume_ratio": 1.0,
    "pitch_ratio": 1.0
}' \
--output speech.mp3
```


## Development

### Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/integration/test_workflow.py

# Run with coverage
make coverage
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run linting
make lint

# Format code
make format
```

### Debugging with LangGraph Studio

DeerFlow uses LangGraph for its workflow architecture. You can use LangGraph Studio to debug and visualize the workflow in real-time.

#### Running LangGraph Studio Locally

DeerFlow includes a `langgraph.json` configuration file that defines the graph structure and dependencies for the LangGraph Studio. This file points to the workflow graphs defined in the project and automatically loads environment variables from the `.env` file.

##### Mac

```bash
# Install uv package manager if you don't have it
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies and start the LangGraph server
uvx --refresh --from "langgraph-cli[inmem]" --with-editable . --python 3.12 langgraph dev --allow-blocking
```

##### Windows / Linux

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
pip install -U "langgraph-cli[inmem]"

# Start the LangGraph server
langgraph dev
```

After starting the LangGraph server, you'll see several URLs in the terminal:
- API: http://127.0.0.1:2024
- Studio UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024
- API Docs: http://127.0.0.1:2024/docs

Open the Studio UI link in your browser to access the debugging interface.

#### Using LangGraph Studio

In the Studio UI, you can:

1. Visualize the workflow graph and see how components connect
2. Trace execution in real-time to see how data flows through the system
3. Inspect the state at each step of the workflow
4. Debug issues by examining inputs and outputs of each component
5. Provide feedback during the planning phase to refine research plans

When you submit a research topic in the Studio UI, you'll be able to see the entire workflow execution, including:
- The planning phase where the research plan is created
- The feedback loop where you can modify the plan
- The research and writing phases for each section
- The final report generation

   ```bash
   uv run main.py --interactive
   ```

2. Select your preferred language (English or 中文)

3. Choose from a list of built-in questions or select the option to ask your own question

4. The system will process your question and generate a comprehensive research report

### Human in the Loop

DeerFlow includes a human in the loop mechanism that allows you to review, edit, and approve research plans before they are executed:

1. **Plan Review**: When human in the loop is enabled, the system will present the generated research plan for your review before execution

2. **Providing Feedback**: You can:
   - Accept the plan by responding with `[ACCEPTED]`
   - Edit the plan by providing feedback (e.g., `[EDIT PLAN] Add more steps about technical implementation`)
   - The system will incorporate your feedback and generate a revised plan

3. **Auto-acceptance**: You can enable auto-acceptance to skip the review process:
   - Via API: Set `auto_accepted_plan: true` in your request

4. **API Integration**: When using the API, you can provide feedback through the `feedback` parameter:
   ```json
   {
     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is quantum computing?"}],
     "thread_id": "my_thread_id",
     "auto_accepted_plan": false,
     "feedback": "[EDIT PLAN] Include more about quantum algorithms"
   }
   ```
