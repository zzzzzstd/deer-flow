The abundance of freshwater fish and seafood is prominent in many dishes, showcasing the region’s natural resources.\\n3.

Besides salted duck, you’ll also find dishes like roast duck and stir-fried duck with vegetables.\\n4. Regional Variations\\nWhile Nanjing cuisine has its distinct identity, it also shares similarities with Jiangsu cuisine as a whole. Jiangsu cuisine is known for its emphasis on sweetness and careful preparation, which can also be seen in many Nanjing dishes.\\n5. Saltiness and Sweetness\\nDishes often balance salty and sweet flavors, with a preference for slightly sweet sauces. This is evident in many of their signature dishes.\\n6. Variety of Local Snacks\\nNanjing is famous for its variety of street foods and snacks, especially in the Fuzimiao (Confucius Temple) area. Popular snacks include buns, dumplings, pan-fried dumplings (锅贴), wontons, shaobing (烧饼), yuanxiao (元宵), and fermented rice wine desserts (酒酿).\\n7. Seasonality and Freshness\\nNanjing cuisine celebrates the seasons, with dishes and ingredients changing to reflect what’s freshly available. For instance, spring brings leeks, snails, and toon leaves; summer offers amaranth greens and gourds; autumn is crab season; and winter features napa cabbage and radishes. The focus is always on using the freshest seasonal produce to enhance flavor and nutrition.\\n⭐Top 15 Local Nanjing Restaurants\\n1. Jinling Hotel Plum Garden – 金陵饭店·梅苑\\nFor over 40 years, Jinling Hotel’s Plum Garden has been a go-to favorite among Nanjing locals. Situated on the second floor, the restaurant features both Beijing and Huaiyang cuisines. The entire restaurant retains the authentic historical flavor.\\nTheir salted duck is regarded as Nanjing’s finest, prepared with premium ingredients and perfectly marinated. The tender, flavorful meat offers a delightful start to any meal.\\nSwamp eels are a popular delicacy in the Jiangsu-Shanghai region. In Huaiyang cuisine, they’re often prepared “ruandou” (软兜) style, where eels are boiled, filleted, and stir-fried with garlic and onions, resulting in tender, noodle-like strips.\\nNo visit to Nanjing is complete without tasting duck blood and vermicelli soup! The version here is exceptional, with no off-putting flavors from the duck blood or innards, and the chili oil adds a wonderfully aromatic touch.\\n📍Address: The second floor of Jinling Hotel, Hanzhong Road, Gulou District\\n2. Hongchu Xiang – 红厨巷\\nFor an authentic Nanjing dining experience, head to the city’s old southern district. This restaurant on Xianhe Street has been a local favorite for over ten years, known for its great food at reasonable prices, attracting food-savvy locals.\\nTheir signature dish is the “ruandou” (软兜) style swamp eel, prepared fresh with hand-deboned eel. This dish never gets old! The eel is tender and silky, served hot with a mildly sweet sauce that’s incredibly satisfying.\\nAnother must-try is the Nanjing-style abalone braised with chicken. The dish is generously portioned, with large, chewy abalones paired with tender chicken that falls right off the bone, soaking up the rich abalone broth for extra flavor.\\nFor something heartier, try the braised beef tendons, served hot in a clay pot, the beef is stewed until tender, with the tendons offering a nice chew.\\nTheir gold medal prawns are another highlight – fresh, with crispy fried shells and tender meat inside, served with a tangy-sweet sauce that bursts with flavor.\\n📍Address: 9 Xianhe Street, Qinhuai District\\n3. Lao Gulou Tangbao – 老鼓楼汤包\\nLao Gulou Tangbao stands out as one of Nanjing’s top soup dumpling spots. The prices are reasonable, making it an excellent choice for sampling Nanjing’s street food.\\nTheir star dish is the classic tangbao, with most diners ordering at least one basket. The dumplings are large, with delicate thin skins and a generous filling of juicy, tender meat. The filling is slightly sweet and soft, and it’s rumored that aspic is added during preparation to enhance the broth. Every basket is made fresh to order, ensuring a burst of freshness with each bite.\\nThe shepherd’s purse tangbao, featuring a mix of the vegetable and meat, is also on the menu. However, the meat remains the dominant ingredient. Personally, I found it less impressive than the original tangbao, with less broth and a less robust flavor.\\nAs for their duck blood and vermicelli soup, a famous Nanjing snack, it tastes similar to other versions around town. However, their soup stands out by being extra generous with the duck offal, making it a hearty and satisfying dish.\\n📍Address: 10 Taipingmen Street, Xuanwu District\\n4. Lvliuju Restaurant – 绿柳居菜馆\\nAs one of Nanjing’s oldest and most iconic establishments, Lvliuju Restaurant boasts a long history and specializes in halal and vegetarian cuisine.

When topped with a special sauce, the flavors truly stand out.\\nAnother highlight is the “Vegetarian Roasted Goose,” made from tofu skin filled with mushrooms, carrots, and other ingredients. The texture and taste offer a delightful mix of the richness of goose and the freshness of vegetarian food.\\nTheir vegetarian buns are also well-known, with a soft dough and flavorful filling that surpasses the taste of typical meat-filled buns.\\nFinally, the beef potstickers are crisp on the outside with a juicy filling inside, reminiscent of soup dumplings, with a hint of sweetness that elevates the flavor.\\n📍Address: 248 Taiping S Street, Qinhuai District\\n5. Zhang Yun Salted Duck – 章云板鸭\\nIn Nanjing, duck dishes are a staple everywhere, deeply ingrained in local life.

The duck meat isn’t too salty on its own, and when topped with sauce, the flavors intensify.\\nTheir brined duck showcases the natural fragrance of the meat, with a perfectly balanced salty taste. While eating a lot might make it seem slightly saltier, it’s still milder compared to other places.\\nNanjing roast duck, unlike the Beijing or Cantonese styles, has a distinct flavor of its own. It tends to be sweeter and is roasted over an open flame, resulting in crispy skin and tender meat. When combined with the restaurant’s special sauce, it becomes even more flavorful and crispy.\\nIn addition to duck dishes, the restaurant also offers delectable items like duck wings and duck feet.\\n📍Address: 228 Shengzhou Road, Chaotiangong Street, Qinhuai District\\n6.

This combination has earned it a loyal following among the city’s older residents.\\nTheir xiaolongbao is especially well-regarded, ranking as one of the top in Nanjing.\\nMuch like Nanjing’s reputation for cultural diversity, Sichuan Restaurant brings together different regional cuisines, making it a fusion eatery that reflects the culinary variety of China.\\n📍Address: 171 Taiping S Rd, Qinhuai District\\n7.

Qifangge Restaurant – 奇芳阁\\nQifangge is renowned for serving authentic halal cuisine from Nanjing, appealing to both locals and tourists alike.\\nOne of the must-try dishes is their Duck Oil Shaobing, a specialty that stands out from regular shaobing thanks to its use of creamy white duck oil, which gives it its distinctive flavor. After baking for about 20 minutes, the shaobing emerges golden and crispy on both sides, with layers of flaky goodness.\\nAnother popular item is the Vegetarian Stuffed Bun, filled with tender spinach or greens, black fungus, sesame, mushrooms, dried tofu, and baked gluten, topped with sesame oil.

On the other hand, inhabitants of countries like Japan, Canada, and the UK can request a visa through the Chinese Visa Application Service Center.\\nIn China, the government has strict regulations on internet access, leading to the blocking of popular websites and social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, and YouTube. To access these sites, a VPN is suggested as a means of bypassing the restrictions. It is important to choose a reputable VPN provider and use caution while doing so. ExpressVPN has been historically deemed the most reliable VPN for this purpose, despite being heavily targeted by China’s censors. Nevertheless, it is still a widely preferred option owing to its ease of installation and user-friendliness.\\nYes. It is crucial to acknowledge that accessing the internet in China may pose limitations due to certain websites being prohibited or filtered. To ensure uninterrupted connectivity while staying in China, purchasing a local SIM card is advisable. For optimum results, acquiring SIM cards from either China Unicom or China Mobile is recommended. While China Mobile has the most comprehensive coverage in China and is a market leader, China Unicom is more compatible with foreign phones, enabling 3G and 4G services. Or you can purchase a SIM card online.\\nYes. Although China is generally a safe country for travel, it is still possible to encounter accidents or other unexpected occurrences. Therefore, obtaining travel insurance can provide a sense of security and financial protection. In my research, I have found that World Nomads is a reputable travel insurance provider that covers a wide range of activities and is recommended for the average traveler. Nevertheless, I advise you to compare insurance quotes from various providers before making a decision.\\nUnfeasible. Obtaining a Chinese driver’s license to rent a car and self-drive may seem like an option, but it is not a practical choice for most foreigners. Therefore, many prefer to opt for a driver or public transportation when navigating China, as it proves to be more convenient.\\nI suggest using Trip for affordable flights to China. As a China-based company, they often offer lower prices compared to foreign companies. Additionally, they offer English-speaking phone support in case of any issues.\\nNot only does Trip offer a wider range of flight options, but it also provides a greater selection of hotels to choose from. Moreover, Agoda is a reliable resource for hotels throughout Asia.\\nTravel adapter and converter: China uses a different electrical system than many other countries, so it’s important to bring a travel adapter and converter if you plan to use electronic devices such as phones, cameras, and laptops.  Sunscreen: The UV index in China can be high, particularly during the summer months, and prolonged exposure to the sun without protection can cause skin damage and increase the risk of skin cancer.Deodorant: It should be noted that finding deodorant in China may not be a simple task.\\nYes. If you’re planning to travel to China for the first time, a travel guidebook can be a valuable resource, and Lonely Planet is one of the most reputable guides available globally. Its comprehensive itineraries and recommendations take into account your personal preferences and can save you both time and money. The insider tips are also extremely helpful in navigating China’s unique cultural landscape like a local.\\n\\nAbout \\nHi!

Jinling Hotel Plum Garden – 金陵饭店·梅苑\\nFor over 40 years, Jinling Hotel’s Plum Garden has been a go-to favorite among Nanjing locals. Situated on the second floor, the restaurant features both Beijing and Huaiyang cuisines. The entire restaurant retains the authentic historical flavor.\\nTheir salted duck is regarded as Nanjing’s finest, prepared with premium ingredients and perfectly marinated. The tender, flavorful meat offers a delightful start to any meal.\\nSwamp eels are a popular delicacy in the Jiangsu-Shanghai region. In Huaiyang cuisine, they’re often prepared “ruandou” (软兜) style, where eels are boiled, filleted, and stir-fried with garlic and onions, resulting in tender, noodle-like strips.\\nNo visit to Nanjing is complete without tasting duck blood and vermicelli soup! The version here is exceptional, with no off-putting flavors from the duck blood or innards, and the chili oil adds a wonderfully aromatic touch.\\n📍Address: The second floor of Jinling Hotel, Hanzhong Road, Gulou District\\n2. Hongchu Xiang – 红厨巷\\nFor an authentic Nanjing dining experience, head to the city’s old southern district. This restaurant on Xianhe Street has been a local favorite for over ten years, known for its great food at reasonable prices, attracting food-savvy locals.\\nTheir signature dish is the “ruandou” (软兜) style swamp eel, prepared fresh with hand-deboned eel. This dish never gets old! The eel is tender and silky, served hot with a mildly sweet sauce that’s incredibly satisfying.\\nAnother must-try is the Nanjing-style abalone braised with chicken. The dish is generously portioned, with large, chewy abalones paired with tender chicken that falls right off the bone, soaking up the rich abalone broth for extra flavor.\\nFor something heartier, try the braised beef tendons, served hot in a clay pot, the beef is stewed until tender, with the tendons offering a nice chew.\\nTheir gold medal prawns are another highlight – fresh, with crispy fried shells and tender meat inside, served with a tangy-sweet sauce that bursts with flavor.\\n📍Address: 9 Xianhe Street, Qinhuai District\\n3. Lao Gulou Tangbao – 老鼓楼汤包\\nLao Gulou Tangbao stands out as one of Nanjing’s top soup dumpling spots. The prices are reasonable, making it an excellent choice for sampling Nanjing’s street food.\\nTheir star dish is the classic tangbao, with most diners ordering at least one basket. The dumplings are large, with delicate thin skins and a generous filling of juicy, tender meat. The filling is slightly sweet and soft, and it’s rumored that aspic is added during preparation to enhance the broth. Every basket is made fresh to order, ensuring a burst of freshness with each bite.\\nThe shepherd’s purse tangbao, featuring a mix of the vegetable and meat, is also on the menu. However, the meat remains the dominant ingredient. Personally, I found it less impressive than the original tangbao, with less broth and a less robust flavor.\\nAs for their duck blood and vermicelli soup, a famous Nanjing snack, it tastes similar to other versions around town. However, their soup stands out by being extra generous with the duck offal, making it a hearty and satisfying dish.\\n📍Address: 10 Taipingmen Street, Xuanwu District\\n4. Lvliuju Restaurant – 绿柳居菜馆\\nAs one of Nanjing’s oldest and most iconic establishments, Lvliuju Restaurant boasts a long history and specializes in halal and vegetarian cuisine. The restaurant is particularly known for its ability to create vegetarian dishes that resemble meat. Their “all-vegetarian banquet” features dishes like “chicken and duck” crafted from tofu skin, gluten, and dried tofu. The elegant ambiance, rich in cultural significance, makes it a popular destination for tourists.\\nA must-try is the “Squirrel Fish,” where tofu is molded into the shape of a fish and deep-fried, creating a crispy outer layer while keeping the inside tender and juicy. When topped with a special sauce, the flavors truly stand out.\\nAnother highlight is the “Vegetarian Roasted Goose,” made from tofu skin filled with mushrooms, carrots, and other ingredients. The texture and taste offer a delightful mix of the richness of goose and the freshness of vegetarian food.\\nTheir vegetarian buns are also well-known, with a soft dough and flavorful filling that surpasses the taste of typical meat-filled buns.\\nFinally, the beef potstickers are crisp on the outside with a juicy filling inside, reminiscent of soup dumplings, with a hint of sweetness that elevates the flavor.\\n📍Address: 248 Taiping S Street, Qinhuai District\\n5. Zhang Yun Salted Duck – 章云板鸭\\nIn Nanjing, duck dishes are a staple everywhere, deeply ingrained in local life. Among them, “Zhang Yun Salted Duck” is a well-known name.\\nThe restaurant’s signature salted duck stands out with its chewy texture, different from roast duck. The duck meat isn’t too salty on its own, and when topped with sauce, the flavors intensify.\\nTheir brined duck showcases the natural fragrance of the meat, with a perfectly balanced salty taste. While eating a lot might make it seem slightly saltier, it’s still milder compared to other places.\\nNanjing roast duck, unlike the Beijing or Cantonese styles, has a distinct flavor of its own.

Most visitors to China will need a visa to enter the country. The type of visa you need will depend on the purpose and duration of your trip, as well as your nationality. If you are a resident of the US, you must apply for a Chinese visa at the Consular Office in the country. On the other hand, inhabitants of countries like Japan, Canada, and the UK can request a visa through the Chinese Visa Application Service Center.\\nIn China, the government has strict regulations on internet access, leading to the blocking of popular websites and social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, and YouTube. To access these sites, a VPN is suggested as a means of bypassing the restrictions. It is important to choose a reputable VPN provider and use caution while doing so. ExpressVPN has been historically deemed the most reliable VPN for this purpose, despite being heavily targeted by China’s censors. Nevertheless, it is still a widely preferred option owing to its ease of installation and user-friendliness.\\nYes. It is crucial to acknowledge that accessing the internet in China may pose limitations due to certain websites being prohibited or filtered. To ensure uninterrupted connectivity while staying in China, purchasing a local SIM card is advisable. For optimum results, acquiring SIM cards from either China Unicom or China Mobile is recommended. While China Mobile has the most comprehensive coverage in China and is a market leader, China Unicom is more compatible with foreign phones, enabling 3G and 4G services. Or you can purchase a SIM card online.\\nYes. Although China is generally a safe country for travel, it is still possible to encounter accidents or other unexpected occurrences. Therefore, obtaining travel insurance can provide a sense of security and financial protection. In my research, I have found that World Nomads is a reputable travel insurance provider that covers a wide range of activities and is recommended for the average traveler. Nevertheless, I advise you to compare insurance quotes from various providers before making a decision.\\nUnfeasible. Obtaining a Chinese driver’s license to rent a car and self-drive may seem like an option, but it is not a practical choice for most foreigners. Therefore, many prefer to opt for a driver or public transportation when navigating China, as it proves to be more convenient.\\nI suggest using Trip for affordable flights to China. As a China-based company, they often offer lower prices compared to foreign companies. Additionally, they offer English-speaking phone support in case of any issues.\\nNot only does Trip offer a wider range of flight options, but it also provides a greater selection of hotels to choose from. Moreover, Agoda is a reliable resource for hotels throughout Asia.\\nTravel adapter and converter: China uses a different electrical system than many other countries, so it’s important to bring a travel adapter and converter if you plan to use electronic devices such as phones, cameras, and laptops.  Sunscreen: The UV index in China can be high, particularly during the summer months, and prolonged exposure to the sun without protection can cause skin damage and increase the risk of skin cancer.Deodorant: It should be noted that finding deodorant in China may not be a simple task.\\nYes. If you’re planning to travel to China for the first time, a travel guidebook can be a valuable resource, and Lonely Planet is one of the most reputable guides available globally. Its comprehensive itineraries and recommendations take into account your personal preferences and can save you both time and money. The insider tips are also extremely helpful in navigating China’s unique cultural landscape like a local.\\n\\nAbout \\nHi! I’m Esther, a passionate traveler with a deep love for China’s rich culture, history, and stunning landscapes. Through this blog, I share my experiences and insights to help you explore the best of what China has to offer—from ancient wonders to hidden gems.

Jinling Hotel Plum Garden – 金陵饭店·梅苑\\nFor over 40 years, Jinling Hotel’s Plum Garden has been a go-to favorite among Nanjing locals. Situated on the second floor, the restaurant features both Beijing and Huaiyang cuisines. The entire restaurant retains the authentic historical flavor.\\nTheir salted duck is regarded as Nanjing’s finest, prepared with premium ingredients and perfectly marinated. The tender, flavorful meat offers a delightful start to any meal.\\nSwamp eels are a popular delicacy in the Jiangsu-Shanghai region. In Huaiyang cuisine, they’re often prepared “ruandou” (软兜) style, where eels are boiled, filleted, and stir-fried with garlic and onions, resulting in tender, noodle-like strips.\\nNo visit to Nanjing is complete without tasting duck blood and vermicelli soup! The version here is exceptional, with no off-putting flavors from the duck blood or innards, and the chili oil adds a wonderfully aromatic touch.\\n📍Address: The second floor of Jinling Hotel, Hanzhong Road, Gulou District\\n2. Hongchu Xiang – 红厨巷\\nFor an authentic Nanjing dining experience, head to the city’s old southern district. This restaurant on Xianhe Street has been a local favorite for over ten years, known for its great food at reasonable prices, attracting food-savvy locals.\\nTheir signature dish is the “ruandou” (软兜) style swamp eel, prepared fresh with hand-deboned eel. This dish never gets old! The eel is tender and silky, served hot with a mildly sweet sauce that’s incredibly satisfying.\\nAnother must-try is the Nanjing-style abalone braised with chicken. The dish is generously portioned, with large, chewy abalones paired with tender chicken that falls right off the bone, soaking up the rich abalone broth for extra flavor.\\nFor something heartier, try the braised beef tendons, served hot in a clay pot, the beef is stewed until tender, with the tendons offering a nice chew.\\nTheir gold medal prawns are another highlight – fresh, with crispy fried shells and tender meat inside, served with a tangy-sweet sauce that bursts with flavor.\\n📍Address: 9 Xianhe Street, Qinhuai District\\n3. Lao Gulou Tangbao – 老鼓楼汤包\\nLao Gulou Tangbao stands out as one of Nanjing’s top soup dumpling spots. The prices are reasonable, making it an excellent choice for sampling Nanjing’s street food.\\nTheir star dish is the classic tangbao, with most diners ordering at least one basket. The dumplings are large, with delicate thin skins and a generous filling of juicy, tender meat. The filling is slightly sweet and soft, and it’s rumored that aspic is added during preparation to enhance the broth. Every basket is made fresh to order, ensuring a burst of freshness with each bite.\\nThe shepherd’s purse tangbao, featuring a mix of the vegetable and meat, is also on the menu. However, the meat remains the dominant ingredient. Personally, I found it less impressive than the original tangbao, with less broth and a less robust flavor.\\nAs for their duck blood and vermicelli soup, a famous Nanjing snack, it tastes similar to other versions around town. However, their soup stands out by being extra generous with the duck offal, making it a hearty and satisfying dish.\\n📍Address: 10 Taipingmen Street, Xuanwu District\\n4. Lvliuju Restaurant – 绿柳居菜馆\\nAs one of Nanjing’s oldest and most iconic establishments, Lvliuju Restaurant boasts a long history and specializes in halal and vegetarian cuisine. The restaurant is particularly known for its ability to create vegetarian dishes that resemble meat. Their “all-vegetarian banquet” features dishes like “chicken and duck” crafted from tofu skin, gluten, and dried tofu. The elegant ambiance, rich in cultural significance, makes it a popular destination for tourists.\\nA must-try is the “Squirrel Fish,” where tofu is molded into the shape of a fish and deep-fried, creating a crispy outer layer while keeping the inside tender and juicy. When topped with a special sauce, the flavors truly stand out.\\nAnother highlight is the “Vegetarian Roasted Goose,” made from tofu skin filled with mushrooms, carrots, and other ingredients. The texture and taste offer a delightful mix of the richness of goose and the freshness of vegetarian food.\\nTheir vegetarian buns are also well-known, with a soft dough and flavorful filling that surpasses the taste of typical meat-filled buns.\\nFinally, the beef potstickers are crisp on the outside with a juicy filling inside, reminiscent of soup dumplings, with a hint of sweetness that elevates the flavor.\\n📍Address: 248 Taiping S Street, Qinhuai District\\n5. Zhang Yun Salted Duck – 章云板鸭\\nIn Nanjing, duck dishes are a staple everywhere, deeply ingrained in local life. Among them, “Zhang Yun Salted Duck” is a well-known name.\\nThe restaurant’s signature salted duck stands out with its chewy texture, different from roast duck. The duck meat isn’t too salty on its own, and when topped with sauce, the flavors intensify.\\nTheir brined duck showcases the natural fragrance of the meat, with a perfectly balanced salty taste. While eating a lot might make it seem slightly saltier, it’s still milder compared to other places.\\nNanjing roast duck, unlike the Beijing or Cantonese styles, has a distinct flavor of its own. It tends to be sweeter and is roasted over an open flame, resulting in crispy skin and tender meat. When combined with the restaurant’s special sauce, it becomes even more flavorful and crispy.\\nIn addition to duck dishes, the restaurant also offers delectable items like duck wings and duck feet.\\n📍Address: 228 Shengzhou Road, Chaotiangong Street, Qinhuai District\\n6. Sichuan Restaurant – 四川酒家\\nDespite its name, Sichuan Restaurant isn’t your typical Sichuan cuisine spot. Instead, it specializes in dishes that appeal to Nanjing locals by toning down the spicy heat commonly associated with Sichuan food and adding Huaiyang elements for a more balanced flavor.\\nThe menu offers a mix of traditional Sichuan items like Mao Xue Wang (spicy blood curd and offal stew) alongside beloved Nanjing dishes like Jinling Soup Dumplings and Red Bean Glutinous Rice Balls. This combination has earned it a loyal following among the city’s older residents.\\nTheir xiaolongbao is especially well-regarded, ranking as one of the top in Nanjing.\\nMuch like Nanjing’s reputation for cultural diversity, Sichuan Restaurant brings together different regional cuisines, making it a fusion eatery that reflects the culinary variety of China.\\n📍Address: 171 Taiping S Rd, Qinhuai District\\n7. Liu Changxing – 刘长兴\\nLiu Changxing, a restaurant with over a century of history since its founding in 1901, is famous for its popular dishes like thin-skinned crab roe soup dumplings, five-nut steamed buns, eel noodles, smoked fish noodles, fish soup wontons, and steamed dumplings.\\nThe signature soup dumplings are delicate, with thin skins that allow the savory meat filling and rich broth to shine through. The meat filling, shaped like a small meatball, strikes a perfect balance between sweet and savory, making it a customer favorite.\\nThe steamed mushroom dumplings feature a tight outer layer and a juicy, flavorful filling.\\nThe fish soup wontons are served in a nutritious broth made from fresh fish, which is light, sweet, and naturally flavorful without the need for pepper. The pairing of the tender fish balls with the wontons creates a delightful and varied texture in each bite.\\n📍Address: 506 Zhongshan E Rd, Qinhuai District\\n8. Qifangge Restaurant – 奇芳阁\\nQifangge is renowned for serving authentic halal cuisine from Nanjing, appealing to both locals and tourists alike.\\nOne of the must-try dishes is their Duck Oil Shaobing, a specialty that stands out from regular shaobing thanks to its use of creamy white duck oil, which gives it its distinctive flavor. After baking for about 20 minutes, the shaobing emerges golden and crispy on both sides, with layers of flaky goodness.\\nAnother popular item is the Vegetarian Stuffed Bun, filled with tender spinach or greens, black fungus, sesame, mushrooms, dried tofu, and baked gluten, topped with sesame oil. The bun’s thin skin and generous filling make it a refreshing and appetite-boosting treat.\\n📍Address: 30 Shengzhou Road, Qinhuai District\\n9. Jining Tangbao – 鸡鸣汤包\\nLocated near Taiping Gate, Jining Tangbao has now become the leading soup dumpling chain in Nanjing. The store always has a long queue, and while the shop’s setting is simple, the enticing aroma of freshly made dumplings fills the space.\\nUnlike traditional Nanjing-style soup dumplings, Jining Tangbao has its pleats facing down, giving it a smooth and glossy appearance. The dumplings are small and delicate, with a thin, translucent skin.\\nWhen eating these soup dumplings, you first bring it to your mouth, take a small bite to taste the sweet broth. The soup is clear and rich in flavor. After sipping the broth, you can then enjoy the whole dumpling, slowly chewing to savor the tender pork combined with the savory broth—it’s an indescribable delight.\\n📍Address: 10 Taipingmen Road, Xuanwu District\\n10. Anleyuan Restaurant – 安乐园\\nFor those seeking morning tea in Nanjing, Anleyuan is a highly recommended spot known for its diverse selection of tea-time snacks. From traditional steamed buns to creative halal pastries, every dish here excels in flavor, aroma, and presentation.\\nThe standout is their Beef Steamed Bun, featuring a flavorful meat filling.

Most visitors to China will need a visa to enter the country. The type of visa you need will depend on the purpose and duration of your trip, as well as your nationality. If you are a resident of the US, you must apply for a Chinese visa at the Consular Office in the country. On the other hand, inhabitants of countries like Japan, Canada, and the UK can request a visa through the Chinese Visa Application Service Center.\\nIn China, the government has strict regulations on internet access, leading to the blocking of popular websites and social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, and YouTube. To access these sites, a VPN is suggested as a means of bypassing the restrictions. It is important to choose a reputable VPN provider and use caution while doing so. ExpressVPN has been historically deemed the most reliable VPN for this purpose, despite being heavily targeted by China’s censors. Nevertheless, it is still a widely preferred option owing to its ease of installation and user-friendliness.\\nYes. It is crucial to acknowledge that accessing the internet in China may pose limitations due to certain websites being prohibited or filtered. To ensure uninterrupted connectivity while staying in China, purchasing a local SIM card is advisable. For optimum results, acquiring SIM cards from either China Unicom or China Mobile is recommended. While China Mobile has the most comprehensive coverage in China and is a market leader, China Unicom is more compatible with foreign phones, enabling 3G and 4G services. Or you can purchase a SIM card online.\\nYes. Although China is generally a safe country for travel, it is still possible to encounter accidents or other unexpected occurrences. Therefore, obtaining travel insurance can provide a sense of security and financial protection. In my research, I have found that World Nomads is a reputable travel insurance provider that covers a wide range of activities and is recommended for the average traveler. Nevertheless, I advise you to compare insurance quotes from various providers before making a decision.\\nUnfeasible. Obtaining a Chinese driver’s license to rent a car and self-drive may seem like an option, but it is not a practical choice for most foreigners. Therefore, many prefer to opt for a driver or public transportation when navigating China, as it proves to be more convenient.\\nI suggest using Trip for affordable flights to China. As a China-based company, they often offer lower prices compared to foreign companies. Additionally, they offer English-speaking phone support in case of any issues.\\nNot only does Trip offer a wider range of flight options, but it also provides a greater selection of hotels to choose from. Moreover, Agoda is a reliable resource for hotels throughout Asia.\\nTravel adapter and converter: China uses a different electrical system than many other countries, so it’s important to bring a travel adapter and converter if you plan to use electronic devices such as phones, cameras, and laptops.  Sunscreen: The UV index in China can be high, particularly during the summer months, and prolonged exposure to the sun without protection can cause skin damage and increase the risk of skin cancer.Deodorant: It should be noted that finding deodorant in China may not be a simple task.\\nYes. If you’re planning to travel to China for the first time, a travel guidebook can be a valuable resource, and Lonely Planet is one of the most reputable guides available globally. Its comprehensive itineraries and recommendations take into account your personal preferences and can save you both time and money. The insider tips are also extremely helpful in navigating China’s unique cultural landscape like a local.\\n\\nAbout \\nHi! I’m Esther, a passionate traveler with a deep love for China’s rich culture, history, and stunning landscapes. Through this blog, I share my experiences and insights to help you explore the best of what China has to offer—from ancient wonders to hidden gems.
